# CSE3310 Project 

Welcome to our SE project for the 2020 Fall semester! 
Each folder has a designated area where we put certain files to keep the repository organized: 

1. Project Code: All code files (i.e. -> .java and .cpp files) will be placed here. 
2. Header Files: All header files (.h) will be kept here for organization purposes.
3. Documents: Any documentation for certain code/functions will stay here. 
4. Presentation: This is where we will keep our work for written/oral presentations for class.
5. Diagrams: This is where our diagrams will be used for planning our project and used for reference.
6. SCRUM: We will be using SCRUM Spreadsheets to keep up with our goals/objectives for each phase of development. 
7. Requirements: All requirements for the project will be kept here as use for reference during development. 

CHANGES MAY BE MADE IN THE FUTURE SUCH AS ADDING NEW BRANCHES OR FEATURES. ALL THINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE DUE TO MAINTAINING FLEXIBILITY DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.
